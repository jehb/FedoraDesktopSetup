FedoraDesktopSetup
==================

Make Fedora instantly better with this install script

There are a few shell scripts out there on GitHub, but most don't do what _I_ want them to, and even fewer actually come with a license. So rather than forking something without a license and feeling vaguely uncomfortable about it, I'm creating my own, and doing it right. Well, right enough. For me. Use at your own risk.
